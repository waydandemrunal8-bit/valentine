Create a single-page interactive Valentine website with the following EXACT design and behavior.

Partner’s name: [partner Name ]

LAYOUT:
- Full-screen soft pink gradient background.
- Floating heart emojis drifting upward across the entire screen.
- A centered white glassmorphism card (rounded corners, soft shadow, blur effect).
- Card stays perfectly centered on all screen sizes.

CARD CONTENT:
- Big bold heading:
  “Will you be my Valentine? 💖”
- Below the heading, place two buttons in a standard horizontal layout:
  - “Yes 💘” button on the LEFT
  - “No 😈” button on the RIGHT
- This initial layout must look clean and normal (no movement at first).

YES BUTTON:
- Pink gradient button
- Rounded pill shape
- Slight glowing animation
- When the “No” button escapes, the “Yes” button should slowly grow larger.
- Clicking “Yes” triggers celebration.

NO BUTTON (IMPORTANT BEHAVIOR):
- Initially behaves like a normal button.
- When the cursor or finger comes CLOSE:
  1) The button SHAKES briefly.
  2) Then it moves a SMALL distance away from the cursor.
- The movement should feel playful and teasing, not aggressive.
- The button MUST:
  - Be impossible to click
  - Never disappear
  - Move anywhere on the full screen (not limited to the card)
  - Stay fully inside the viewport at all times
- On mobile, tapping near the “No” button should also make it dodge.

INTERACTIONS:
- Mouse proximity triggers shake → dodge behavior.
- Each dodge slightly increases the size of the “Yes” button.
- Motion should be smooth and natural.

ON YES CLICK:
- Fire confetti animation from the center.
- Increase floating hearts.
- Replace the card content with a romantic celebration message that includes the partner’s name.
- Message tone:
  emotional, soft, sincere, slightly dramatic.
- Example style:
  “I tried to be brave, but my heart already knew the answer.”

ANIMATION STYLE:
- Soft
- Romantic
- Smooth easing
- No harsh motion
- Clean modern UI

MOBILE:
- Fully responsive
- Touch-friendly
- Same teasing No-button behavior on tap proximity

FINAL STEP:
- Publish the website
- Give me a shareable live link
